KeysExport Viewer
=================

About
-----
KeysExport Viewer is a viewer for the KeysExport.xml file available to MSDN 
subscribers. This file contains all of the serial numbers that they have 
generated or that have been generated for
them.

It's very easy to download new versions of this file, but I'd rather not 
have to read through a bunch of XML if I'm trying to grab the right key to 
use on an install. At the time I created this project, this was also a 
great way to learn some new-to-me .NET development.

A huge thank you to [all those who have contributed](https://github.com/rnelson/KeysExportViewer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) 
to the project, helping keep it alive and useful to developers.
